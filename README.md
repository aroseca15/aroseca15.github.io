# Nice to meet you!

Here you will find what I have of my website so far:

Home: 
    I wanted this to be a friendly first impression. I live in a small town with lots of family owned small business. In my future consideratons I may or may not add a caption explaining the San Francisco vacation photo. 

    In the Jumbotron you will notice the "Jump To My Work" button. This redirects straight to my portfolio in the event that my potential client is limited on time and wants to see examples of my work right away.

    On the bottom of my page are icons that are direct links:
        In order from left to right:
            GitHub
            Twitter
            Email
            Resume (in PDF form)
            Linkedin
    The icons and adjacent links are featured on all four pages.

About Me:
    This is the page where my short bio will go. I am still in the process of working with career services to adjust this further as soon as Heather finds time to get back to me.

    Icons and Links are below

Portfolio: 
    This is the page that will showcase my work in the form of link cards with images. At the moment I have no projects yet but that will change soon. The buttons now marked "Go somewhere" will be remade at a later date and will direct the potenial client to the app of their choice to review.

Contact Me:
    This is the final page. The "Submit form" button is a direct link to my email. You must submit your name and email. Then a new message is created addressed to me (aroseca15@gmail.com) from the client.
